# Time Calculator
### Description
The Time Calculator is a simple tool that allows you to calculate your clock-out time for an 8-hour workday. It's especially useful for planning your work schedule, ensuring compliance with legal requirements, and managing your time effectively.

## Features
- Calculate clock-out time based on your clock-in time and lunch break duration.
- Set a default 5-hour lunch break duration (customizable in future updates).
- Provides an estimated clock-out time considering a standard 8-hour workday.
### Usage
1. Enter your clock-in time using the Time Picker.
2. Adjust the lunch break duration using the slider provided.
3. The app will automatically calculate and display your estimated clock-out time.

### Legal Compliance
The app currently assumes a default 5-hour lunch break duration, based on legal requirements in California. However, users from other regions may need to adjust this setting to comply with local regulations.

### Future Improvements
- Customizable lunch break duration to accommodate different legal requirements and work hours.
- Develop theme with colors, fonts and sizes to make app distigushable.
- Enhanced user interface with customizable themes and styling options.
